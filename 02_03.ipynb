    "The URIs in your grounding metadata are redirect URLs (Vertex AI grounding redirect links). They will work as links but may not show the final host in the label unless you use the title from the grounding chunk (we use that when available).\n",
    "If you want the links inserted inline near the exact place they were used in the textual itinerary (rather than as a “Sources” list), we can implement a more advanced step that maps grounding support segments to locations in the text and inserts hyperlinks in-place. That’s slightly more work but doable.\n",
    "Do you want me to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Patch 02_03.ipynb now with this change and remove the debug prints, or\n",
    "Apply the simpler fix and keep debug prints for one more run so you can confirm the exact mapping?"
